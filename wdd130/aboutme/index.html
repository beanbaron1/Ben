    <p>Hi all, don't really have a nickname, so instead please enjoy this picture that my lovely gf took of me today. I live in Utah, I'm working, taking a couple classes through pathways and I'm serving in a bishopric right now. My hobbies include playing games with friends, playing computer or console games by myself, working out when I have time and learning new things.</p>
    <p>I'm taking this class to learn a new skill set. I've always said that I like learning new things and in concept I like how computers work and want to learn to use them better. Hopefully I'll enjoy working with them haha. I've learned a bit about HTML and CSS before and I had a rough time with it, but going through the material this week I seemed to understand things better, so things are looking up!</p>
    <P>Something I've learned about learning, especially with coding and computers, is that everyone has to start somewhere and everyone is gonna have problems and questions and usually they're the same ones. So I'll try to be helpful and be helped as much as I can since I think any problem a peer has will probably be a problem I'll have or have already had. Another thing I realized is that I forgot some of the things I learned last semster and going over my notes would've been helpful, had I actually kept any haha. So this time I'll try to leave notes and tips for myself and those that read my comments. This week I learned that to view my .html files quickly on the browser I can use the shortcut: alt + l then alt + o. Cheers :D</P>
